## Development of Virtual metrology for E-learning

A Virtual Laboratory project was funded by ***Université de Bordeaux***.

> I2M (Institut de Mécanique et d'Ingénierie)  
https://www.i2m.u-bordeaux.fr/

The Virtual Laboratory is designed for engineering student to exercese the use of metrology equipments.
* Student can conduct simulation in this platform to enhance what they have learned.
* The deviations on the part can be amplified to help student understand specifications and their application cases.
* Various equipments will be introduced, including some high precision and expensive ones. Pre-exercise in virtual laboratory will reduce the risk of equipment broken.

Following is a scene of the Virtual Laboratory, and a link to the video demo.

In this work, I mainly contribute on the measurement simulations:
* Provide a simplex algorithm in Lua.
    * <https://i7242.github.io/Simplex-in-Lua/>
* Customize optimization problem for different measurement equipments.
    * The measurement is considered as an optimization problem, which minimize the distance between the measurement equipment and part. Following is the measurement principle for caliper.

The Virtual Laborator was developed based on Inscape3D platform (which is developed for serious games).

## Generation of Non-ideal Parts for Tolerance Analysis and Visualization

The shape of real manufactured mechanical parts are non-ideal. Defects exist in their surfaces and dimensions. Some of them are large enough that can influence the perceived quality, while others influences the product functionality.

In precision engineering, we design, analysis and control the geometrical and dimensional tolrances to guarantee the product's quality. To achive more precise and realiable simulation result, the form defect on part surface need to be considered.

Here is a method that generates discrete part model with defects. A figure that concludes the generation process is shown as below:

* First, discrete model is generated by tessellation form the nominal/ideal model.
    * The sampling rate depends on real engineering requirements. Here we just use a low sampling rate as an example.
    * The identification of different surfaces is easy when linked to CAD systems. Here we assume the model is from other sources, like 3D camera. A spectral clustering based method is used to segment the model.
* Simulate the surface defects on each surface. The methods used here includes homogenuous transformation, modal decomposition, and their combination. We can control the shape and value of defects by parameters.
* The combination of surfaces uses Finite Element Analysis and Penalty Function based method. This can guarantee:
    * there exist no self intersection on the model edge;
    * the defects on different surfaces are independed;
