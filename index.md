# [Simple PLA](/pages/simple_pla)
Reviewed machine learning course on Coursear during holidays. Here is a simple implementation of the PLA [[read more]](/pages/simple_pla). Also, the complete code (Pluto notebook) is [here](https://github.com/i7242/IL-VENTE-D-OR/blob/master/ML/NaivePLA.jl).

Besides, highly recommend Prof. Lin's course: [Machine Learning Fundations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ntumlone-mathematicalfoundations?).

# [K-means Clustering](/pages/k-means/)

Last week I tried SageMaker on AWS. The given test example was clustering MNIST hand writting numbers using k-means. Apart from daily development works, this seems a good opportunity to review the k-means with Julia. [[read more]](/pages/k-means/).

There was a [document](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/julia-on-sagemaker.pdf?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card) explains how to setup Julia environment. Besides, SageMaker currently only have Python SDK, not sure if they will support Julia later.
