# [K-means Clustering](/pages/k-means/)

Last week I tried SageMaker on AWS. The given test example was clustering MNIST hand writting numbers using k-means. Apart from daily development works, this seems a good opportunity to review the k-means with Julia. [[read more]](/pages/k-means/).

There was a [document](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/julia-on-sagemaker.pdf?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card) explains how to setup Julia environment. Besides, SageMaker currently only have Python SDK, not sure if they will support Julia later.
